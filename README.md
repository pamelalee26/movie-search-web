# Movie Search Website
### Introduction
A React-based web application allowing users to view and analyse data about movies exposed via a REST API. 

### Dataset
The movies dataset used is based on publicly available data from IMDB and other sources. The data describes a subset of movies released since 1990.
I will not work with this database directly. Instead, all interactions take place via my school's published REST API. I will be able to fetch the movie data using HTTP GET operations and handle registration and login processes from my React application to the API through appropriate HTTP POST requests. 

### Demo
Please view "Demo" to view a word document report of my website, as the API is private and cannot be viewed publicly.
